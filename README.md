## About this project

In this project, I create a streaming data pipeline for customers clickstreams data flow. The data flow is consumed by Kafka, and send to Google cloud Databricks.I used fully managed Kafka service platform Confluent Kafka generate continues fake customer clickstream data and user lookup data, I join these data flow together and directly subscribe by Google cloud databricks service. I use databricks to process this stream data flow and to finish some aggregation and load result to Google cloud storage
